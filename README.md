# Streamlining-Ticket-Assignment-for-Efficient-Support-Operations


This repository contains a ServiceNow update set titled “Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations.” The purpose of this update set is to enhance the efficiency of IT support processes by automating ticket assignment. Instead of relying on manual distribution, the update set introduces rules and logic that intelligently route incoming tickets to the most appropriate support agents or groups. This not only reduces response delays but also balances workloads, ensures faster resolution, and improves overall customer satisfaction.
